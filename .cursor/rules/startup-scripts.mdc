# CCOPINAI Project Startup Requirements

## CRITICAL: Never Use `npm start`

**NEVER** use `npm start` directly for this project. This is **STRICTLY PROHIBITED** and will cause inconsistent behavior and break the application flow.

## Required Startup Scripts

### Frontend Development
**ALWAYS** use the proper startup script:
```bash
./scripts/start_frontend.sh
```

### Full Application (Frontend + Backend)
For running both frontend and backend together:
```bash
./scripts/start_all.sh
```

## Why This Matters

1. **Environment Setup**: The startup scripts handle proper environment variable loading
2. **Port Configuration**: Scripts ensure correct port assignments and conflict resolution
3. **Dependency Management**: Scripts handle proper service startup order
4. **Development Consistency**: Ensures all developers use the same startup process
5. **Configuration Loading**: Scripts properly load `.env` files and export required variables

## Enforcement

- ❌ **NEVER** run `npm start` directly
- ❌ **NEVER** run `expo start` directly  
- ❌ **NEVER** run `cd frontend && npm start`
- ✅ **ALWAYS** use `./scripts/start_frontend.sh`
- ✅ **ALWAYS** use `./scripts/start_all.sh` for full stack

## Script Locations

- Frontend: [scripts/start_frontend.sh](mdc:scripts/start_frontend.sh)
- Full Stack: [scripts/start_all.sh](mdc:scripts/start_all.sh)

## Memory Reference

This rule is backed by memory ID: 2505740 which states: "CRITICAL: Never use `npm start` for this project. Always use the proper start script located at `scripts/start_frontend.sh`. This is mandatory for consistent results and proper environment setup."

**Remember**: Consistency in startup procedures is essential for reliable development and deployment.
